## Project Description

In the Maze Run, we will be moving a character through a complex maze. The maze will have hidden features that take away the 'lives' of the character, including when the character goes down dead ends and spontaneous rocks/items in the way of the character. Along with looking out for these dangers, the user will need to answer random trivia questions displayed on the screen every 30 seconds and if they get it wrong they lose a 'life'. Once 3 'lives' are lost, the game will automatically end through the quit program. The character will be controlled by the user through the keyboard, the arrows will be used to move the character through the maze and the letters/numbers will be used to answer the trivia questions.
